**Platform:** IOS Devices  
**Name:** Happy Penny  
**Language**: Swift  
**Frameworks**: SpriteKit  

### Description:
This game was a pasasion project during the corona lockdown, as intership oppertunites where scarce. It was my attempt to experience the full software development lifecycle. The game is a simple endless runner. This was a one person project, where I took care of analysis, design, implmentation (code and art), testing, and deployment. I attempted to replicate each phase of the SDLC, as professionally as possible. One exaple of this was during the testing phase, where I gathered individuals to test the game on their person devices, and used their feedback to improve the experice, and debug any issues. It was released on the apple store for one whole year. This was a great leaning experince and it taught me many of the caviates that are not necessarily explored in academic circles.
