**Platform:** Windows  
**Name:** None   
**Language**: C++   
**Frameworks**: GLM, GLEW  

### Description:
This engaging game project was an integral part of my Computer Graphics module, where I skillfully demonstrated my proficiency with the OpenGL API and expertise in implementing stunning visual effects using shaders. To create an immersive experience, I meticulously designed and constructed many objects (meshes) manually. This involved defining various properties such as vertex positions, texture coordinates, and normals. These essential properties were efficiently passed to the shaders using Vertex Array Objects (VAO) and Vertex Buffer Objects (VBO).

The true beauty of the game lies in the exquisite visual effects achieved through the implementation of advanced shader techniques. Among the breathtaking effects are the captivating fog, realistic bump mapping, and seamless multi-texturing, which combine to create a visually stunning and lifelike environment.

The game's lighting system was ingeniously designed with two distinctive types: directional lighting and spotlighting. The player can dynamically toggle these lighting modes on and off based on their input, allowing for an interactive and dynamic gaming experience.

Furthermore, I utilized a Frame Buffer Object (FBO) to craft a unique rear view window in the heads-up display (HUD). This clever addition provides the player with an invaluable perspective, enhancing their situational awareness and adding an extra layer of gameplay depth.

Overall, this project serves as a testament to my proficiency in Computer Graphics, highlighting my ability to implement complex visual effects, leverage the power of shaders, and create captivating gameplay experiences using the OpenGL API.

**Language**: C++  
**Frameworks**: GLM, GLFW, FMOD, BulletEngine  

### Description:

This ambitious project was a pivotal part of my Advanced Games Technologies module, showcasing my expertise in implementing crucial features, innovative ideas, and mastery in 3D mathematics. The game itself is an engaging third-person shooter, challenging players to defeat region bosses while highlighting my diverse skill set.

The project incorporates a range of essential features, including seamless player input, a sophisticated camera technique for a smooth and immersive experience, and dynamic lighting strategies that enhance the game's visual appeal. To bring life to the virtual world, I integrated mesh animations and captivating sound effects, creating a realistic and enjoyable gameplay environment.

A simple yet functional heads-up display (HUD) was thoughtfully included, featuring a health bar, timer, and a minimap to aid the player in their quest. These additions contribute to a seamless and immersive gaming experience.

Creativity shines through in the gameplay design, where I introduced inventive ideas to elevate the player's experience. The game showcases three distinct types of projectiles and five unique pickups, each serving a distinct purpose, adding strategic depth and excitement to the gameplay.

One of the game's highlights is the presence of five diverse enemy non-player characters (NPCs), each equipped with their own unique set of attacks and moves. The enemies' behavior is expertly managed through finite state machines, making their actions intelligent and challenging.

Throughout the project, 3D mathematics played a pivotal role in various aspects, including physics simulations, collision detection, camera manipulation, and essential transformations such as scaling, rotation, and translation.

In conclusion, this project is a testament to my ability to create captivating and feature-rich games, demonstrating expertise in vital game development elements, innovative gameplay mechanics, and the seamless application of 3D mathematics.
