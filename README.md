# Portfolio
This repository contains a description and video demonstration of most of my game projects. Bellow you will find all the games in the order that they were developed. Each one showcases different skills that are relevant in game development. This portfolio is not exhaustive but it showcases some of my noteworthy porjects.

## Mobile Game Development

**Platform:** IOS Devices  
**Name:** Happy Penny  
**Language**: Swift  
**Frameworks**: SpriteKit  

### Description:
This game was a pasasion project during the corona lockdown, as intership oppertunites where scarce. It was my attempt to experience the full software development lifecycle. The game is a simple endless runner. This was a one person project, where I took care of analysis, design, implmentation (code and art), testing, and deployment. I attempted to replicate each phase of the SDLC, as professionally as possible. One exaple of this was during the testing phase, where I gathered individuals to test the game on their person devices, and used their feedback to improve the experice, and debug any issues. It was released on the apple store for one whole year. This was a great leaning experince and it taught me many of the caviates that are not necessarily explored in academic circles.

## Advanced Game technologies / Gameplay development

**Platform:** Windows  
**Name:** Spikey Ball Palooza  
**Language**: C++  
**Frameworks**: GLM, GLFW, FMOD, BulletEngine  

### Description:
This project was for my Advanced Games Technologies module. The game is a simple third person shooter where the player needs to defeat each regions boss. It supossed to demonstrate my ability to implment essential features, creative ideas that are unique, and an ability with 3D maths.  Some of the essential features included are: player input, camera technique, dynamic lighting strategy, mesh animation and sound effects. Additionally, A simple primitve heads up display with a functioning healthbar, timer and minimap was also implmented. The creative ideas implmented were mostly invovled in the gameplay. The game has three types of projectiles, and five pickups each serving a different purpose than the others. Futhermore, five unique enemy non player characters where created with each their own unique set of attacks and moves. The enemies use finite state machines to determine the their current action. The 3D maths was mostly applied in, physics, collision detection, camera technique, and transformations (scale, rotate, translate), and others.

## Computer Graphics


**Platform:** Windows  
**Name:** None   
**Language**: C++   
**Frameworks**: GLM, GLEW  

### Description:
This game was a project assigned to me for my Computer Graphics module. Its is meant to demonstrate my ability with the OpenGL API and implmenting visual effects in the shader. Many of the object (meshes) are manually constructed by defining the properties (e.g. vertex position, texture coordinates, and normal). These properties are passed to the shaders using a VAO and VBO. In the fragment shader a few visual effects have been implmentd, such as fog, bump mapping, and multi-texturing. Two types of lighting were also implmented, directional and spotlight, which can be turned on and off based on player input. Additionally a frame buffer object was used to give the player a rear view window in the heads up display.

## Games Architecture

<br><br>

**Platform:** Windows, MacOS  
**Name:** None   
**Language**: C#  
**Frameworks**: XNA, Monogame  

### Description:
This porject was assigned to me for my Computer Games Architecture module. The game is a 3D top view dungeon crawler. This project focuses on the modularity of the game's elements, by employing an event driven architecture. The code also ensures the use of common design paterns (e.g. Singleton, Observer, and Factory) where appropriate. Some of the games implmented features include: data driven world construction, serialization of data (load and save mechanism), seperation of collision detection and collision response, and others. Additionally, I built a UI framework that uses custom reusable templates to allow the for the craetion on new UI to be implmented with ease.
